                    <h2>HTML</h2>
                    <p>The building block of all Websites; I am Fluent in HTML and use it efficiently to produce Webpages, like this one. </p>

                    <h2>CSS</h2>
                    <p>Without CSS websites will be made up of blocks of text with no organisation and no styling. I have studied CSS deeply and i have paired it together with my HTML skills to make aesthetically pleasing Websites. </p>

                <article class="languages" id='js'>
                    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                    <p>JavaScript was the first language I was introduced to during my Fullstack course, it was tough however, I had the most fun learning JS. Solving problems, writing Functions and Debugging my code really made me feel like i was a fully established Front-end Developer.</p>

                <article class="languages"  id='react'>
                    <h2>React</h2>
                    <p>I have spent hours teaching myself React and it has paid off, with it I was able to produce webpages that loaded changing elements much fastere then regualr JavaScript. It ehlped me understand the DOM better and how the virtual DOM can be used to speed up chnages made by user-interactions.</p>

                <article class="languages"  id='c'>
                    <h2>C#</h2>
                    <p>Last but not least of my coding language repertoire is C#. Learning C# was different to the other languages i have learnt, I studied C# on my own inorder to make my own game on the UnityEngine. With it i was able to code 2 games and 1 still in works; It's much easier then JS but I still want to spend time polishing my skills in it. </p>
